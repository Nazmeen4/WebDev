Create an eCommerce website with the following functionality.
Show all the products with appropriate details (title, description, images[0], rating, price after discount, etc)
Implement search functionality for the products by title.
Show the price after the discount percentage.
Initially on rendering the page there should be no records
When I click on the Fetch button, an API call should happen and the result should be rendered.
For the first time only 10 objects should be rendered, when clicking on more the next 10 also should render
------------------------------
/*let response = fetch("https://dummyjson.com/products").then((data)=>{
    return data.arrayBuffer();
}).then((data)=>{
    return (data)
})
//console.log(response)
let arr=Array.from(response.products)*/
